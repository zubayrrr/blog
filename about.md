I am Zubayr Ali, a 22 year old Web Developer from Hyderabad, India.  
 I specialize in Front-end Development, working with technologies such as JS, ReactJs, Gatsby.

I enjoy learning different technologies and creating something useful out of it every so often.

I've a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am a Blockchain, Cyber security, FOSS and Linux enthusiast.

Currently, I am working on my startup [QuantCtrl](https://quantctrl.com/), we're building the next generation of data analytics tool for the industry 4.0.

When I am not busy working, I I love listening && curating music of all genres. I also read books and workout.

I've a [wiki](https://wiki.zubayrali.in/) or a "digital garden" - where I make notes using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) about pretty much everything I learn and discover, which includes notes about programming, philosophy, etc.
